In this folder you can find the proposed XML and XSL for OOTS Projectathon TC10 about human readable transformation during the Evidence Provider Preview session.
These files we received from our specifications team that is in contact with the ELMO/EMREX community.

In attachment you can find:
-	example.xml which is the actual XML evidence that we propose would need to be returned for TC10
-	elmo.xsl which is the stylesheet that can provide the human readable (html)
-	schema.xsd which is here for support only as the xsd is not needed in the transformation
-	example.html which is here for support only as this is the expected output of the actual transformation

In case you have any feedback or suggestions, please let us know via a Teams message or via a mail to EC-OOTS-SUPPORT@ec.europa.eu
